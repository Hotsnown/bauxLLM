23. Subordination to Mortgages; Estoppel Certificate.
 
    Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage(s), deed(s) of trust, ground lease(s) or other lien(s) now or subsequently arising upon the Premises, the Building or the Property, and to renewals, modifications, refinancings and extensions thereof (collectively referred to as a Mortgage).  The party having the benefit of a Mortgage shall be referred to as a
Mortgagee.  This clause shall be self-operative, but upon request from a Mortgagee, Tenant shall execute a commercially reasonable subordination agreement in favor of the Mortgagee.  As an alternative, a Mortgagee shall have the right at any time to subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease.  Upon request, Tenant, without charge, shall attorn to any successor to Landlords interest in this Lease.  Landlord and Tenant shall each, within 10 days after receipt of a written request from the other, execute and deliver a commercially reasonable estoppel certificate to those parties as are reasonably requested by the other (including a
Mortgagee or prospective purchaser).  Without limitation, such estoppel certificate may include a certification as to the status of this Lease, the existence of any defaults and the amount of Rent that is due and payable.
