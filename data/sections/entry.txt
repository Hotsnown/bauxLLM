10. Entry by Landlord.
 
    Landlord may enter the Premises to inspect, show or clean the Premises or to perform or facilitate the performance of repairs, alterations or additions to the Premises or any portion of the Building.  Except in emergencies or to provide Building services, Landlord shall provide Tenant with reasonable prior verbal notice of entry and shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Tenants use of the Premises.  If reasonably necessary, Landlord may temporarily close all or a portion of the Premises to perform repairs, alterations and additions.  However, except in emergencies, Landlord will not close the Premises if the work can reasonably be completed on weekends and after Building Service Hours.  Entry by Landlord shall not constitute a constructive eviction or entitle Tenant to an abatement or reduction of Rent, except to the extent that as a result of such entry and activity by Landlord, the Premises, or a portion of the Premises, are rendered untenantable, in which case Tenant shall be entitled to an abatement of Rent as provided in Section 7.03.
