    19.01 Upon the occurrence of any Default under this Lease, whether enumerated in Section 18 or not,Landlord shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies without any notice (except as expressly prescribed herein) or demand whatsoever (and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant hereby specifically waives notice and demand for payment of Rent or other obligations, except for those notices specifically required pursuant to the terms of Section 18 or this Section 19, and waives any and all other notices or demand requirements imposed by applicable law):
 
(a) Terminate this Lease and Tenants right to possession of the Premises and recover from Tenant an award of damages equal to the sum of the following:

(i) The Worth at the Time of Award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of
termination;
 
(ii) The Worth at the Time of Award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would
have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant affirmatively proves could have been reasonably avoided;
 
(iii) The Worth at the Time of Award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant affirmatively proves could be reasonably avoided;
 
(iv) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment either proximately caused by Tenants failure to perform Tenants obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom; and
 
(v) All such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time under applicable law.
 
The Worth at the Time of Award of the amounts referred to in parts (i) and (ii) above, shall be computed by allowing interest at the lesser of a per annum rate equal to: (A) the greatest per annum rate of interest permitted from time to time under applicable law, or (B) the Prime Rate plus 5%.  For purposes hereof, the Prime Rate shall be the per annum interest rate publicly announced as its prime or base rate by a federally insured bank selected by Landlord in the State of California.  The Worth at the Time of Award of the amount referred to in part (iii), above, shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus 1%;
 
(b) Employ the remedy described in California Civil Code  1951.4 (Landlord may continue this
Lease in effect after Tenants breach and abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due, if
Tenant has the right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations); or
 
(c) Notwithstanding Landlords exercise of the remedy described in California Civil Code  1951.4 in respect of an event or events of default, at such time thereafter as Landlord may elect in writing, to terminate this Lease and Tenants right to possession of the Premises and recover an award of damages as provided above in Paragraph 19.01(a).
 
    19.02 The subsequent acceptance of Rent hereunder by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver ofany preceding breach by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular Rent so accepted, regardless of Landlords knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent.  No waiver by Landlord of any breach hereof shall be effective unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Landlord.
 
    19.03 TENANT HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS CONFERRED BY SECTION 3275 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF
CALIFORNIA AND BY SECTIONS 1174 (c) AND 1179 OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OF CALIFORNIA AND
ANY AND ALL OTHER LAWS AND RULES OF LAW FROM TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT DURING THE LEASE TERM PROVIDING THAT TENANT SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHT TO REDEEM, REINSTATE OR RESTORE THIS LEASE
FOLLOWING ITS TERMINATION BY REASON OF TENANTS BREACH.  TENANT ALSO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LEASE.
 
    19.04 No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Landlord is intended to be exclusive of anyother right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing by agreement, applicable law or in equity.  In addition to other remedies provided in this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to injunctive relief, or to a decree compelling performance of any of the covenants, agreements, conditions or provisions of this Lease, or to any other remedy allowed to Landlord at law or in equity.  Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an event of default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such default.
 
    19.05 If Tenant is in Default of any of its non-monetary obligations under the Lease, Landlord shall havethe right to perform such obligations.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of such performance upon demand together with an administrative charge equal to 10% of the cost of the work performed by Landlord.
 
    19.06 This Section 19 shall be enforceable to the maximum extent such enforcement is not prohibited byapplicable law, and the unenforceability of any portion thereof shall not thereby render unenforceable any other portion.
