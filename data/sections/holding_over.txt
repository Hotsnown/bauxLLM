22. Holding Over.
 
    If Tenant fails to surrender all or any part of the Premises at the termination of this Lease, occupancy of the Premises after termination shall be that of a tenancy at sufferance.  Tenants occupancy shall be subject to all the terms and provisions of this Lease, and Tenant shall pay an amount (on a per month basis without reduction for partial months during the holdover) equal to 150% of the sum of the Base Rent and Additional Rent due for the period immediately preceding the holdover.  No holdover by Tenant or payment by Tenant after the termination of this Lease shall be construed to extend the Term or prevent Landlord from immediate recovery of possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise.  If Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises to a new tenant or to perform improvements for a new tenant as a result of Tenants holdover and Tenant fails to vacate the Premises within 15 days after notice from Landlord, Tenant shall be liable for all damages that Landlord suffers from the holdover.
