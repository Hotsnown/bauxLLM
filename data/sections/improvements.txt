8. Leasehold Improvements.
 
    All improvements in and to the Premises, including any Alterations (defined in Section 9.03) (collectively, Leasehold Improvements) shall remain upon the Premises at the end of the Term without compensation to Tenant, provided that Tenant, at its expense, in compliance with the National Electric Code or other applicable Law, shall remove any Cable (defined in Section 9.01 below).  In addition, Landlord, by written notice to Tenant at least 30 days prior to the Termination Date, may require Tenant, at its expense, to remove any Alterations that, in Landlords reasonable judgment, are of a nature that would require removal and repair costs that are materially in excess of the removal and repair costs associated with standard office improvements (the Cable and such other items collectively are referred to as Required Removables). Required Removables shall include, without limitation, internal stairways, raised floors, personal baths and showers, vaults, rolling file systems and structural alterations and modifications.  The Required Removables shall be removed by Tenant before the Termination Date.  Tenant shall repair damage caused by the installation or removal of Required Removables.  If Tenant fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, Landlord may perform such work at Tenants expense.  Tenant, prior to execution of this Lease, and thereafter at any time Tenant requests approval for a proposed Alteration, may request in writing that Landlord advise Tenant whether the Alteration, or any portion thereof, is a Required Removable.  Within 10 days after receipt of Tenants request, Landlord shall advise Tenant in writing as to which portions of the alteration or other improvements are Required Removables.
