11. Assignment and Subletting.
 
    11.01 Except in connection with a Business Transfer (defined in Section 11.04), Tenant shall not assign,sublease, transfer or encumber any interest in this Lease or allow any third party to use any portion of the Premises (collectively or individually, a Transfer) without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if Landlord does not exercise its recapture rights under Section 11.02. Without limitation, it is agreed that Landlords consent shall not be considered unreasonably withheld if the proposed transferee is an occupant of the Building or if the proposed transferee, whether or not an occupant of the Building, is in discussions with Landlord regarding the leasing of space within the Building.  If the entity(ies) or individual(s) or any combination thereof which directly or indirectly owns or controls the voting shares/rights of Tenant such that such entity(ies) or individual(s) can select a majority of the seats on Tenants board of directors, changes, whether in a single transaction or a set of integrated transactions, such change of ownership or control shall constitute a Transfer unless Tenant is an entity whose outstanding stock is listed on a recognized securities exchange or if at least 80% of its voting stock is owned by another entity, the voting stock of which is so listed.  Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1995.310 of the California Civil Code, or any similar or successor Laws, now or hereinafter in effect, and all other remedies, including, without limitation, any right at law or equity to terminate this Lease, on its own behalf and, to the extent permitted under all applicable Laws, on behalf of the proposed transferee.  Any Transfer in violation of this Section shall, at Landlords option, be deemed a Default by Tenant as described in Section 18, and shall be voidable by Landlord as between Landlord and Tenant.  In no event shall any Transfer, including a Business Transfer, release or relieve Tenant from any obligation under this Lease, and Tenant shall remain primarily liable for the performance of the tenants obligations under this Lease, as amended from time to time.
 
    11.02 Tenant shall provide Landlord with financial statements for the proposed transferee, a fully executedcopy of the proposed assignment, sublease or other Transfer documentation and such other information as Landlord may reasonably request.  Within 15 Business Days after receipt of the required information and documentation, Landlord shall either: (a) consent to the Transfer by execution of a consent agreement in a form reasonably designated by Landlord; (b) reasonably refuse to consent to the Transfer in writing; or (c) in the event of an assignment of this Lease or subletting of more than 20% of the Rentable Square Footage of the Premises for more than 50% of the remaining Term (excluding unexercised options), recapture the portion of the Premises that Tenant is proposing to Transfer.  If Landlord exercises its right to recapture, this Lease shall automatically be amended (or terminated if the entire Premises is being assigned or sublet) to delete the applicable portion of the Premises effective on the proposed effective date of the Transfer, although Landlord may require Tenant to execute a reasonable amendment or other document reflecting such reduction or termination.  Tenant shall pay Landlord a review fee of $1,500.00 for Landlords review of any requested Transfer.
 
    11.03 Tenant shall pay Landlord 50% of all rent and other consideration which Tenant receives as a resultof a Transfer that is in excess of the Rent payable to Landlord for the portion of the Premises and Term covered by the Transfer.  Tenant shall pay Landlord for Landlords share of the excess within 30 days after Tenants receipt of the excess.  Tenant may deduct from the excess, on a straight-line basis, all reasonable and customary expenses directly incurred by Tenant attributable to the Transfer.  If Tenant is in Default, Landlord may require that all sublease payments be made directly to Landlord, in which case Tenant shall receive a credit against Rent in the amount of Tenants share of payments received by Landlord.
 
    11.04 Tenant may assign this Lease to a successor to Tenant by stock transfer or sale, merger,consolidation or the purchase of substantially all of Tenants assets, or assign this Lease or sublet all or a portion of the Premises to an Affiliate (defined below), without the consent of Landlord, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied (a Business Transfer): (a) Tenant must not be in Default; (b) Tenant must give Landlord written notice at least 15 Business Days before such Transfer; and (c) if such Transfer will result from a stock transfer or sale, merger, stock transfer, sale or consolidation of Tenant with another entity or entities, then the Credit Requirement (defined below) must be satisfied.  Tenants notice to Landlord shall include information and documentation evidencing the Business Transfer and showing that each of the above conditions has been satisfied.  If requested by Landlord, Tenants successor shall sign a commercially reasonable form of assumption agreement.  Affiliate shall mean an entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with Tenant.  The Credit Requirement shall be deemed satisfied if, as of the date immediately preceding the date of the Transfer, the financial strength of the entity with which Tenant is to merge or consolidate is not less than the greater of that of Tenant (i) as of the date of this Lease, and (ii) as of the day prior to the proposed Ownership Change, as determined (x) based on credit ratings of such entity and Tenant by both Moodys and Standard & Poors (or by either such agency alone, if applicable ratings by the other agency do not exist), or (y) if such credit ratings do not exist, then either (1) if the successor entity has been in existence for two or more fiscal years, in accordance with Moodys KMV RiskCalc (i.e., the on-line software tool offered by Moodys for analyzing credit risk) based on CFO-certified financial statements for such entity and Tenant covering their last two fiscal years ending before the Transfer, or (2) if the successor entity has been in existence for less than two fiscal years, the Credit Requirement shall be deemed satisfied if, as of the date immediately preceding the date of the Transfer, Tenants successor shall have a net worth which is at least equal to the greater of Tenants net worth (i) as of the date of this Lease, or (ii) as of the day prior to the proposed Ownership Change.
